1.)* What is Version Control System(V.C.S.)?
    - GIT is V.C.S. for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
    - It is primarily used for source code managemnt in software development, but it can be keep track of changes in any set of files. 


2.)* Why we need any Version Control System(v.C.S)?
    - It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem,
       who introduced an issue and when, and more.

    - Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. 


3.)* What is the difference between SVN and Git?
   
1.
	SVN is a centralised version control system. In svn, when a user checkout’s the repository, he will get only the source code. Repository is not distributed to the user. In SVN multiple users connect to a single/centralized server. If that server goes down, no user will be able to work.

	Where as Git is distributed VCS. In the sense, when user clones the repository, he will get source code as well as complete repository on his local disk. since repository is distributed across multiple users and each user has their own local repository, user will be able to submit the changes locally without connecting to the master server. (i.e he can also work offline)

2.
Git has staging area. Users can leverage this staging area to stage/save all the changes related to some issue/bug and  commit everything at once into local repository. hence, all the changes will be recorded as part of single sha/commit. user's get an opportunity to logically group the changes and commit as single changeset. this enables better tracking.

3.
Since git is distributed in nature, almost all transactions happen locally in the client machine and hence less overhead on the server so git is faster.
Users are free to create any no. branches in Git. where as in svn, all branches reside in server side, so may cause svn to be overloaded with multiple requests.

4.
Git seems to be good with merging.

5.
Git stores each change as SHA values but SVN uses simple numbers as revisions.


4.)* Which VCS you prefer? SVN Or Git? Why?
  
  - GIT, Most operations in Git only need local files and resources to operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your network. 
  - If you’re used to a CVCS means(SVN) where most operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git with unworldly powers. 
  - Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.

5.)* What are the advantages of Git over SVN?

   - Initialization - The git init is the command to create local repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new empty repository. 
                      Subversion uses svn import command to create initial repository.

   - Creating working copy - The git clone command creates a copy of the repository for modification. It is similar to svn checkout command.Unlike SVN, 
                             Git makes no distinction between the working copy and   the central repository—they are all full-fledged Git repositories. 
                             All the changes that are made in the working copy are committed in the local repository, not with central repository as done in svn. 
                             The communication is mostly local and this helps improve performance and avoiding locking issues.

   - Committing changes in original repository - The changes are put back in original repository by git pull or git push commands depending upon where the command is executed.
 
   - Staging area - This is unique feature of Git. It is called index. It is kind of temporary area where the changes could be reorganized before committing to the repository. 
                    This is an additional layer in addition to working copy and repository. 
                    Once you are satisfied the changes can be committed.


6.) Why we call Git as Distributed VCS?
   
   - In a DVCS(such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository. Thus if any server dies,
     and these systems were collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every checkout is really a full backup of all the data.


7.) Can you explain Git's End-to-End work flow?

  - 

8.) How do you clone the code using git?

  - we can clone the code using this command git clone repo url
						      ----------


9.)* What is the difference between Commit & Push?

  - This command git commit is moving data or files from stage area to local-repo (.git) area.
                 ----------                              ----------    ----------
  - This command git push is moving data or files from local-repo(.git) to remote area.
                 --------                             -----------          ------


10.)* What is the difference bet'n Push and Pull?

   - This command git push is moving data or files from local-repo(.git) to remote area.
                 --------                             -----------          ------
   - git pull fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last cloned from) it. It’s important to note that the pull command pulls the data to your local repository.
    ---------                                                   ------                           

11.) Can you explain Git architecture?
              
                GIT

	  |  |10K files|  | |--------> Remote Repository.
	  |   ----|-----   |

	----------------------------
       |Source   |  Stage   |  .git | ---------> local Repository.
        ----------------------------

12.)* What is the diff. bet'n Centralized and Distributed VCS.

   
13.) Have you ever created Remote repositories in Git? How?
   
    - We can create repository using two ways:-
      a) login to github account and click to new repository option and enter reqired name and create it.
      b) Using git init we can create local repository and push it to central repository.
